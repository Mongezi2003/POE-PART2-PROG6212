# Claims Management System (CMCS)

## Project Overview

The **Claims Management System** (CMCS) is a web-based application designed to streamline the submission, approval, and verification of claims submitted by lecturers. The system enables users to submit claims with supporting documentation, and allows managers to approve or reject claims. It aims to enhance transparency and efficiency in managing academic claims, particularly for lecturer hours.

## Features

- **Lecturer Claim Submission**: Lecturers can submit claims with hours worked and hourly rates.
- **Supporting Document Upload**: Upload multiple supporting documents (e.g., timesheets, receipts) for each claim.
- **Claim Review**: Academic managers and programme coordinators can view, approve, or reject claims.
- **Status Tracking**: Claims move through various statuses (e.g., Pending, Approved, Rejected).
- **File Management**: Uploaded files are stored on the server with their paths stored in the database for easy access.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Frontend**: Razor Views (HTML, CSS, C#)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **Testing**: xUnit
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CMCS_WebApp.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```bash
    cd CMCS_WebApp
    ```

3. **Configure the database**:
   
   Update the `appsettings.json` file with your PostgreSQL database credentials:

   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=cmcs_db;Username=postgres;Password=mageba2003"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Apply Migrations**:
   Run the following commands to set up the database and apply migrations:

   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

5. **Run the application**:
   Start the application using:

   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

   The application will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### File Upload Directory

Ensure the `uploads` directory exists in the project root for storing uploaded files. If not, the system will automatically create it.

### Testing

To run unit tests, execute the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Database Models

- **Lecturer**: Stores lecturer information (ID, name, email).
- **Claim**: Stores claim information, including hours worked, hourly rate, and claim status.
- **SupportingDocument**: Stores file paths of supporting documents linked to each claim.

## Future Enhancements

- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement user roles (e.g., lecturers, managers) to restrict access to certain actions.
- **Reporting**: Add reporting features to summarize claims over specific periods.
- **Email Notifications**: Send email notifications when claims are approved or rejected.
